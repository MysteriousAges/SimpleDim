This is the SimpleDim Dimension Configuration Information file. It should tell you how to write and
set up your server's custom dimensions.

Every dimension entry consists of a name, followed by a parameter list in the form:
	
	myCustomDimension { parameter: value; parameter: value; parameter: value; }

SimpleDim will try to parse your configs to the best of its ability, however, it is ultimately up
to you to set up the parameters and values correctly. For instance, if you install other dimension
mods, you must take care to avoid creating a SimpleDim dimension that shares a dimension ID with
one of these mods.

Parameters:

There are two parameters required for all dimensions:

	id : The dimension ID of the dimension - take care to not collide with other SimpleDim or other
			mods' dimensions! (This may be trickier if you use Mystcraft.)
			Integer to use as the dimension ID.
	
	type : The type of terrain the dimension will consist of. Currently, the supported types are:
			overworld - Will create an overworld type dimension. Use the seed parameter with this
						type to produce a different overworld, or no seed to clone it.
			superflat - Creates a dimension in the style of the Minecraft Superflat world type.
						Use with the generator parameter to customize the result to your liking.
			singleBiome - Creates a world that contains only one biome. Use with the biome
						parameter to set which biome is used, and the seed parameter to change up
						the terrain if desired.
			void - Creates an empty world with nothing inside.

These parameters can be used with any dimension type:
	
	spawn: Used to set the spawn location of the dimension.
			Set of 3 comma separated integers. Enclosing with parentheses is recommended, but not
			strictly required. (x, y, z) where y cannot be negative. (Don't spawn under the world!)
			Usable with all world types.
	
	seed: Sets the seed for the dimension, overriding the global server seed. Useful to recreate
			your perfect world in a dimension, or bring past servers to your new server with
			seamless terrain generation.
			Integer to use as the seed. Can be specified in decimal with optional negative sign (-)
			or as a hexadecimal value.
			Applicable to 'superflat', 'overworld' and 'singleBiome' types. (Void type may use it,
			but will not affect terrain, since there is none.)
	
	loadSpawn: Whether or not the spawn of the dimension should be loaded regardless of whether
			players are present. May help speed up transfer time to the dimension.
			Either 'true' or 'false. Other values will be ignored.
	
Other types of parameters are used in conjunction with specific types of dimensions:
	
	generator: Used with the 'superflat' type. Controls what the world consists of. Uses the same
			format as the Superflat configuration screen, such as what you can build and customize
			using http://www.minecraft101.net/superflat/
			Must be enclosed with either single or double quotes.
			Only applicable to 'superflat' type.
	
	biome: Used to set the biome of 'singleBiome' worlds, specified as the biome name without
			spaces. "plains", "extremeHills", "mushroomIsland" etc. Mod biomes that have assigned
			names are supported.
			Name of the biome.
			Only applicable to 'singleBiome' type.

Example Entries:

customAge { id: 16; type: overworld; spawn: (12, 75, -153); seed: 15203824 }

	- Creates an Overworld type dimension with spawn set to (12, 75, -153) and a seed of 15203824.

justAVoid { id: -2; type: void }

	- Creates a void age with dimension ID 2.

justGrassAndSlimes { id: 3; type: superflat; generator: "2;7,2x3,2;1;village" }

	- Creates a dimension similar to the default Superflat setting.
