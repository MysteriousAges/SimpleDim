Tired of having to write complicated Mystcraft ages just so your players won't quarry the overworld?

This might be the mod for you.

## Features
* Supports 4 types of dimensions:
  * Overworld clone, or with a seed override
  * Superflat for that flat world experience
  * Single Biome, perfect for Extreme Hills mining ages, or infinite rolling plains.
  * Void, fantastic for falling to your doom in!
* Set spawn points via config file
* Easily create new dimensions with an easy to write config style

## Enhanced Teleport
Base command: /etp

The following options are supported:
/etp <target> - teleports user to target player's location.
/etp <player> <target> - teleports player to target's location.
/etp x y z - teleports user to specified coords.
/etp <target> x y z - teleports target to specified coords.
/etp x y z <dimension> - teleports user to specified coords in dimension.
/etp <target> x y z <dimension> - teleports target to specified coords in dimension.

The <dimension> parameter can either be the numeric ID assigned in the config, or the dimension name used to give the config entry for that dimension a name.
